# AI-Chatbot-RAG-Approach
A sophisticated chatbot using pretrained models and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach with LangChain libraries. Here's a sneak peek into the process:

📚 Book: "The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham"

📊 Vector DB: Chroma

🤖 Models: Tinyllama, BART, Phi3

🔍 Process:
- Preprocessed text using advanced libraries.
- Stored data in a vector database.
- Retrieved documents based on user queries.
- Implemented all models on the book for response generation and summarization.

🌟 Key Highlights:
- Tinyllama (HuggingFace): Defined complete pipeline for query-based responses.
- BART (HuggingFace): Generated summaries of retrieved documents.
- Phi3 (Ollama): Integrated for context-aware responses.
