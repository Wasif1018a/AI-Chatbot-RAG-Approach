# 🤖 AI-Chatbot – RAG Approach

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot** built using pretrained models and vector databases. The system is designed to read and understand complex text (in our case, *"The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham"*) and provide meaningful answers, summaries, and context-aware responses.

---

## 📚 What It Does

* Processes and stores book text into a **vector database** for efficient retrieval.
* Uses **RAG** to combine search with generation, making answers more accurate.
* Supports multiple models for different tasks:

  * **TinyLlama (HuggingFace):** Query-based responses.
  * **BART (HuggingFace):** Summarization of retrieved content.
  * **Phi-3 (Ollama):** Context-aware responses.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing (main.py)**

   * Reads the book PDF.
   * Splits and cleans text.
   * Embeds content and stores it in a **Chroma vector DB**.
   * Defines, tests, and evaluates models using cosine similarity.

2. **Backend Logic (GUI_class.py & GUI_main.py)**

   * `GUI_class.py`: Defines model classes and loads the saved vector DB.
   * `GUI_main.py`: Handles user queries, runs retrieval + model pipelines, and serves results through Flask.

3. **Frontend (GUI.html)**

   * Simple, browser-based interface to interact with the chatbot.
   * Connects to Flask backend to display answers and summaries.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Vector Search with Chroma** – fast and relevant document retrieval.
* **Multiple Models Integrated** – response generation, summarization, and context understanding.
* **Flask-based GUI** – easy to use in the browser.
* **Evaluation with Cosine Similarity** – ensures better accuracy and relevance.
